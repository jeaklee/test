# Static Site
-------------

This is a static website built using ExpressJS and Webpack.
It is responsive, supports all modern browsers and IE8+, and
has a customizable theme at compile time (via the settings.sass
file).

# Gettings started
------------------

Download the source and execute the following commands to
get started:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

**Note**: The build step can take up to 3 minutes due to
the large images in the source.
